## Title: STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### Selected Categories:
- Category 1: XML
- Category 2: RDF, RDFS, SPARQL

### System Requirements:
1. Before running the system, make sure the following Python package is installed:
```
pip install FPDF
```

### Run Instruction:
1. Open main.py using any Python IDE(example: VS Code, PyCharm).
2. Run the file and follow the console menu instructions.

### Files Overview:
1. main.py - Main entry point of the system. Provides menu to access student, subject, grading, and reporting modules.
2. student_module.py - Handles student-related operations (add, display, delete). Uses XML for data storage.
3. subject_module.py - Manages subjects, including prerequisite checks and filtering by programme.
4. grading_module.py - Allows grade entry, GPA calculation, CGPA update, and eligibility filtering.
5. rdf_utils.py - Turn XML file into RDF graph, and perform searching using SPARQL.
6. data folder - XML and RDF files generated by system will be stored in this folder.
7. report folder - student report, subject report, and student result slip generated by system will be stored in this folder.

### Features Summary:
1. Manage student and subject records using XML.
2. Store and update student grades.
3. Calculate CGPA based on credit hours and grading systems.
4. Recommend subjects using SPARQL based on programme and prerequisite status.
5. Generate reports with FPDF.
6. Use of RDF graphs and SPARQL to query and reason with semantic data.
